rt.cpan.org automatically provides bug tracking for all CPAN distributions.
This talk aims to show CPAN authors (that's you!) ways to get the most out of
this ready-made tool for managing bugs in your distributions. We'll cover saved
searches, dashboards, bug feeds, command line access, the REST API,
distribution notes, and more. Even if you're not (yet!) a CPAN author, you'll
stand to learn some tricks for using rt.cpan.org as a copious bug reporter.

I work for Best Practical Solutions, the company behind RT and the maintainers
of rt.cpan.org on the perl.org network. I plan to cover:

• Submitting bugs 
• Linking between bugs 
• Public guest interface vs. PAUSE 
• Searching and saved searches 
• Dashboards 
• Notifications and feeds 
• Command-line access (bin/rt) 
• REST API access 
• Regular exports 
• Distribution notes 
• How to tell the world your bugtracker is somewhere else, what that means for rt.cpan.org, and why. 
• Integration with Github/webhooks (if complete in time for YAPC!) 
• Other topics that may arise between now and YAPC or in a Q&A session at the end.


* how to participate?
* curl incant for bin/rt
    or separate dist
* making internal queue visible
* actions by email
* adjust default home page
    notify those who've customized that there's a new version available?
    (see if they've actually customized, or just reset to default at a point in time?)

* stats as an introduction
